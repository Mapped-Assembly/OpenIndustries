# SQLite city-dump runtime v5

Open-Industries owns accounts, match identity, private deposits, inventory, jobs, time and receipts in a SQLite database. The game path does not use Supabase, Postgres, the scene CLI login, provider keys, or a hosted service. The independent Node process advances work even when all browsers and MCP clients disconnect.

This is a two-player recovery session in a finite 96 × 56 municipal dump. The shared map contains fourteen waste sites, roads, obstacles, two bases and neutral outposts. Each crew can survey with its two robots, reserve and haul finite loads, inspect delivered material, process every initial waste family through supported recovery routes, and recharge. All jobs run in SQLite while clients are absent. Manufacturing and construction use the durable owned queue; combat, capture and persistent victory/tie resolution use the authoritative server. `ready_for_recovery` and `ready_for_full_game` are true. The live service advertises the same exact contract at `/health`; the web backend checks it and the independent scheduler before full-match startup.

## Run

Use Node **22.18 or newer** (Node's built-in `node:sqlite`) and install with `npm ci`. In a local `.env` file set:

```dotenv
OI_GAME_PORT=8790
OI_GAME_DB=.astra/game/runtime.sqlite
OI_GAME_ALLOW_SIGNUP=true
```

Start the independently supervised service:

```sh
npm run game:server
```

It binds **127.0.0.1** only. Keep it running alongside the tower-defense backend on the same machine. The database and its WAL are private server files. Unix creation permissions are restricted; use a private service-account directory with appropriate ACLs on Windows. Back up SQLite with its backup API or stop the service before copying the database. Do not copy a live `.sqlite` file without its transaction state.

The tower-defense backend performs sign-up/sign-in, keeps the returned game token server-side, and launches one MCP process per browser session with:

```dotenv
OI_GAME_TOOLS_ENABLED=true
OI_GAME_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790
# OI_GAME_SESSION is supplied securely by the backend, never in tool arguments.
```

Disable `OI_GAME_ALLOW_SIGNUP` after provisioning accounts if registration should be closed. Accounts use a normalized 3–40 character username and a 12–256 character password. Passwords use per-account salted scrypt; only SHA-256 digests of random 256-bit session tokens are stored. Sessions expire after eight hours and logout revokes them immediately. Password reset/account recovery is not implemented in this foundation.

## Authority and transport

The loopback service provides JSON-only server-to-server endpoints: `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login` (username/password), `GET /auth/session`, `POST /auth/logout`, `GET /health`, and `POST /game`. Authenticated endpoints use a bearer game session. `/game` accepts exactly `{name, arguments}` and revalidates the published MCP schema. It derives the owner from the stored session; no request can choose a player ID. Browser-origin requests are rejected; browser traffic belongs behind tower-defense's cookie-authenticated backend.

The stdio MCP server exposes ten versioned tools with complete input/output JSON Schemas:

| Tool | Arguments in addition to `version: 5` | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openindustries.game_manufacturing_catalog` | `match_id` | Exact reviewed bills of materials, queue/storage limits and rates |
| `openindustries.game_manufacturing_preview` | `match_id`, `recipe_id`, `batch_ids`, `product_ids`, `component_ids` | Owned-only eligibility without reservation |
| `openindustries.game_science_catalog` | `match_id` | Validated catalog pinned to this participant match |
| `openindustries.game_evaluate` | `match_id`, `target_id`, `query`, `design_id`, `temperature_c` | Private preview using owned evidence and installed machines |
| `openindustries.game_list_matches` | `cursor` (null for first page) | Up to 20 owned memberships and `next_cursor`, ordered by match ID |
| `openindustries.game_describe` | None | Static contract; does not certify deployment health |
| `openindustries.game_create_match` | `command_id` | Waiting snapshot and a one-use, one-hour invite |
| `openindustries.game_join_match` | `command_id`, `match_id`, `invite_code` | Second participant's private snapshot |
| `openindustries.game_read_match` | `match_id` | Full authorized snapshot for polling/reconnect |
| `openindustries.game_command` | `command_id`, `match_id`, `expected_revision`, `action` and its target IDs | Durable receipt and snapshot |

Actions: `enqueue_manufacturing`, `salvage_starter_asset`, `set_production_machine`, `destroy_manufactured_product`, `survey_robot`, `collect_robot`, `return_robot`, `recharge_robot`, `interrupt_robot`, `retreat_robot`, `inspect_batch`, `inspect_component`, `start_material_process`, `inspect_deposit`, `collect_deposit`, `start_processing`, `pause_job`, `resume_job`, `cancel_job`, `dismantle_machine`, `abandon_match`, `rotate_invite`, `finish_recovery`. Their target fields are defined by `tools/list`; unknown fields are rejected. A full snapshot replaces local state. Never merge another player's private data or infer opponent inventory from shared revision changes.

SQLite WAL, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` protect each transition. Input reservations, output creation, energy changes, revision updates and the receipt commit together. Identical command IDs and payloads return their original immutable receipt, including after restart. Reusing an ID for different work fails. After `CONFLICT`, read and reconcile before using a new ID. After `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` or an invalid response, retry the **same** ID and payload before issuing new work. A replayed receipt can contain an older snapshot: read again for current state.

The service ticks once per second and catches up from persisted timestamps after restart. No browser or MCP process drives the clock. A heartbeat older than 15 seconds blocks new work; reads and recovery/cancellation remain available. Clock rollback cannot refund energy or repeat progress. Each tick processes up to 100 matches in oldest-tick order; this implementation targets a small single-host deployment.

## Material fixture and limits

Each player has one finite cable deposit and a separator connected to a 20 kJ charged battery and 100 W solar generator. Generation and processing advance together; excess generation is explicitly spilled at capacity. Solar charging needs no manufactured input. Each base includes one tower, two scavenger robots, an inspection bench and a parked fabricator. `starter_ledger` assigns every supplied component/stock quantity and balance mass to one asset or the store; state saves check that allocation. These prebuilt facilities and the charged battery guarantee a first cable loop with no circular build dependency. In new matches the robot hauls an uninspected batch to the base; the paid bench job establishes composition before separation. The legacy instant starter-cable actions are accepted only for migrated pre-robot matches. The 10 kg fixture takes 20 seconds and 10 kJ; copper recovery is integer `19/20`, HDPE recovery is integer `6/7`, and all remaining constituents become residue. Outputs are recovered **ungraded** material. These balance rules certify no physical property or manufactured part.

Pause/resume preserves progress; cancellation returns reserved material while keeping energy spent. Destruction dissipates remaining battery energy and cancels the machine's work; abandonment cancels both players' live jobs. Every state save verifies constituent, component allocation and energy conservation: remaining base energy + job expenditure + robot charging transfers + dissipated energy + spilled solar = initial energy + generated solar. Solar stops when the separator/battery is dismantled or the session ends. A completed processing job consumes its input and creates each output role once. Inspection jobs reserve and return their target, recording evidence without changing its mass.

Requests: 8 KiB at the game boundary, 256 KiB results, 30-second MCP-to-service deadline. Limits: three open memberships/account, twenty created matches/account/day, 256 successful commands/player/match (abandonment remains available), sixteen sessions/account, 1,000 accounts. Authentication is bounded to four concurrent scrypt operations and thirty attempts/minute per loopback address. History/receipts are retained; archival is future work.

## Verification and compatibility

`npm run test:mcp-game` uses the production SQLite engine and real service/MCP processes. It checks native account authentication, session revocation/expiry, hidden projections, ownership, two-player membership, simultaneous collection, duplicate receipts, transaction fault rollback, independent scheduling with clients absent, hard process restart, exactly-once outputs, conservation and 256 starting material partitions. CI runs on Linux and Windows.

Wire version 5 rejects older clients. SQLite schema 7 stores the shared simulation envelope and guards the new starter recovery rules against older binaries. Opening schema 6 only raises this compatibility marker; it does not rewrite existing state or receipts. The earlier schema 4 initializes persistent robots, private field observations and finite stock once; existing matches retain their original starter-cable path, while robots can recover their other sites. Existing field state is never reinitialized. Schema 3 added pinned material versions, private observations and component records referencing existing stock. Recovered legacy outputs receive no retroactive property evidence. Existing work and immutable receipts remain intact. The earlier schema-2 migration first upgrades v2 matches: preserve accounts, sessions, original cable IDs/composition/observations, batches, jobs, energy and immutable receipts; grant and ledger the new starter equipment/map once. Previous abandoned sessions become completed/abandoned. New private world contents are generated once and persisted. Legacy recipes remain `dump-v1`; map/catalog/sensor versions are independently pinned. Back up the database before upgrading, and upgrade the matching client together. An old request receipt stays immutable; its v2 command ID cannot be reused for a different v5 payload. This does not import or access the historical Postgres runtime. Scene-authoring persistence remains separate.

## World, lifecycle and privacy

`world` is the shared public projection: positions, exterior waste categories, depleted status, roads, obstacles, outposts, tower slots and pinned versions. `base`, `field`, `science`, `deposits`, `batches` and `jobs` are the caller's private projection. The HMAC generation seed, uninspected composition/components, other crew's assets/inventory and observations never enter snapshots, receipts, error details or logs. Public depletion and lifecycle are intentionally shared. Each side has mirrored geometry and the same bounded starter recipe/energy path; cable composition is independently sampled so one crew's assay does not reveal the other's.

All seven waste categories can be surveyed and recovered in new matches. Only owned robot/cargo/job/evidence state is projected. Public site revisions and availability reflect reservations, but disclose no constituent totals. Field-collected batch mass/form are visible; constituent fields remain null and canonical material projections stay uninspected until a paid bench test. Vehicle/appliance loads may contain unknown hazardous components: paid inspection identifies the suspect load; only its matching cold isolation recipe can recover the target metal. All other constituents remain quarantined, and ordinary processing remains forbidden. No field scan certifies alloys, chemistry, purity or battery health.

Lifecycle: waiting → active → completed. A waiting host can rotate its one-use, one-hour invitation after refreshing/signing in; older codes are invalidated. Expiry completes a waiting session with `invite-expired`. Abandonment cancels work and completes with `abandoned`. After each crew finishes a cable job, each can explicitly accept `finish_recovery`; both acceptances archive the session with `recovery-complete`. None of these reasons claims a combat winner (`winner_slot: null`). Completed history remains readable through membership listing/reconnect.

Revisions protect discrete commands and job/lifecycle transitions. Fractional clock progress and solar charging update `server_time_ms` and the full snapshot without changing the command revision every millisecond. Commands first check the supplied revision, then advance authoritative time and revalidate actual resources/readiness in the same transaction. Poll every two seconds and replace the whole snapshot. Time/energy never depend on client clocks.

## Material science v4

The canonical `@openindustries/material-science` package lives in `packages/material-science`. Its checked-in JavaScript/declarations are rebuilt and checked for drift in CI. The downstream UI vendors that exact build for tests/demo; runtime decisions always execute inside this SQLite service. The pure engine was moved from tower-defense's earlier calculation core, with evidence, result, component and substitution validation added.

Matches pin `materials-v2`, `balance-v2` and `bench-v1`; mismatched versions fail rather than silently adopting new rules. `openindustries.game_evaluate` accepts owned IDs and a catalog design only, with query `use`, `process`, `substitution` or `component`. It cannot receive batch composition, custom recipes, machine capabilities, property values, grades or identity. An eligible preview is not a reservation; startup rechecks real state atomically.

A bench inspection costs 300 J over 3 seconds at 100 W, sharing the existing power ledger and single live-job limit. Owner-scoped observations store target/revision, server timestamp, bench position and bounded fixture evidence. Copper-wire and supported recovered-stock fixture values are labeled synthetic game measurements. Metal values cover only 20 °C; HDPE has an explicit bounded service-temperature interval. Unsupported grades remain unknown. Starter-component tests reference existing stock allocations and certify only the named game-maintenance fixture. They never credit bulk material.

The separator uses the same library's integer/rational cable plan, preserving the 10 kg / 10 kJ fixture. Inspected residue can pass through `recover-cable-residue`, recovering half its remaining copper (floor grams) and retaining every other constituent/remainder. Outputs do not inherit grade or property evidence. The game adds six cold starter-cell recovery/isolation recipes using the existing bench and separator. These do not grant the unavailable furnace, press or molding machines used by the pure catalog. Paid inspection of their usable outputs establishes bounded game-grade evidence for existing use evaluations. See [starter recovery processing](game-recovery-processing.md) for routes, limits and quarantine. The [manufacturing queue](game-manufacturing-queues.md) constructs and operates those machines from eligible stock and tested components.

See the downstream [science design](https://github.com/isayahc/tower-defense/blob/main/docs/material-science.md) for documented reference anchors, bounds, geometry and balance choices. These are bounded gameplay rules, not alloy inference, arbitrary chemistry or engineering certification.

`npm run test:materials` validates the canonical catalog and property units/bounds, all six families, 300 constituent cases, approved geometry, owned/private evidence, durable paid inspections, exact retries, stock allocations, nine residue passes and idempotent v3 migration. Existing service/MCP transaction and restart tests remain in `npm run test:mcp-game`.

## Robot and sensor rules (v5)

Robot balance is pinned as `robots-v1`, observations as `field-sensors-v1`. Values are explicit game fixtures. New and migrated crews receive one 200 g magnetic/inductive probe per robot, each added once to the starter allocation ledger; their already allocated batteries start with a recorded 8 kJ field-energy budget.

| Rule | Authoritative behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Travel | Four-neighbor deterministic grid routes; obstacles and deposit interiors block passage. Each metre takes 250 ms at 80 W plus 1 W per started 250 g of cargo. |
| Payload | At most 10 kg. Reservations take a constituent-conserving whole-gram portion; choosing a candidate class does not secretly sort the material. |
| Collection | Adjacent reachable surface; 250 W for `ceil(grams × 2/5)` ms, then automatic hauling/unloading. Start requires enough battery for the whole trip home. |
| Camera/depth | Up to 8 m line of sight, 2 seconds at 20 W; visible geometry/exterior cues only. |
| Magnetic/inductive | Up to 2 m, 3 seconds at 30 W; response classes only. |
| NIR / thermal | Supported bounded evidence rules and required-kit catalog; unavailable without installed hardware. Kit manufacturing/installation belongs to tower-defense #7. |
| Uncertainty | Dirt, surface occlusion, low signal and geometry affect evidence. The same target revision, position, method and conditions reuse the original observation and timestamp; rescanning still costs energy. |
| Charging | Return/unload first. One shared 500 W base charging port; processing has priority, other chargers wait. An empty base battery throttles charging to solar input. Transfers are recorded in both energy ledgers. |
| Interrupt / retreat | Release an uncollected reservation; retain carried cargo and energy already spent. Retreat reroutes home. No refund of travel or collection work. An interruption that would strand a robot midway through its last grid step is refused. |

`survey_robot` accepts robot/site IDs and an installed sensor. `collect_robot` requires an owned observation at the site's current revision and an observed candidate class (including unclassified). `return_robot`, `recharge_robot`, `interrupt_robot` and `retreat_robot` accept only an owned robot ID. Routes, amounts, durations, properties, charges and clocks are never accepted from clients.

Deposits, pending reservations, cargo and unconsumed batches participate in one global constituent ledger, including cross-crew collection. Every robot separately conserves initial energy plus charging transfers against remaining energy plus expenditure. Event-based advancement gives identical physical results across fine ticks and long restart catch-up. Active field work or carried cargo blocks mutual completion; starting a robot job clears prior finish consent. Abandonment cancels robot work, returns uncollected reservations, and retains already carried material in the archived snapshot.

Limits: 96 retained field jobs (return/recharge can replace the oldest finished entry) and 128 cached field observations per crew per match, within the existing 256-command/256-KiB snapshot bounds. The original fabricator stays parked until its hardware is deliberately reclaimed and assembled with validated stock into the operating fabricator. Sensor readings and bench values are synthetic fixtures, not real-world metrology or safety certification.

## Shared command/history integration

Native v5 material/robot rules live in `server/domains/game.mjs`; the registered adapter in
`server/domains/game-core.mjs` stores jobs, private observations and resources in the shared
`SimulationInstance`. SQLite schema 6 pins `native-game@dump-world-v1/schema1`. Common
clock/job/resource code checks progress and accounting before the envelope, history and
receipt commit together. Native rates, routing, charger priority and outcomes remain domain
policy. Wire v5 schemas and native receipt bytes are unchanged.

Each advancement runs at most 1,000 physical boundaries per instance, retaining unprocessed
downtime as debt. The server worker drains it without browsers. Snapshot reads expose the
original `scheduler_healthy=false` while debt remains; a command that cannot catch up returns
`SCHEDULER_UNAVAILABLE` without committing a partial command. Wait/read/retry with the same
intent after recovery. No client supplies elapsed time or progress. Variable-rate charging and
250 ms travel retain exact integer-millisecond event boundaries rather than being quantized.

`POST /simulation/history` returns authorized snapshots and retained post-state history. It
never exposes raw world truth or another crew's private assets/evidence. Existing journals
retain `game-runtime@dump-world-v1/schema3`, distinct from the envelope, wire and SQLite
versions. `game-history-v3` projects both native historical rows and new envelopes; an older
projection-bound cursor requires a fresh snapshot. Existing streams and cursor keys remain.

SQLite versions 0–4 upgrade atomically through the envelope migration to 6, preserving native IDs, inventory, paid work,
observations, pins, revisions and receipts. Existing science/robot upgrades run only when
needed; `shared-core-cutover` records the envelope migration. Resource opening balances
capture existing stock and sinks without inventing historical effects. Failed migration rolls
back state, version and history together. Unknown module/robot/material pins fail with a
restore-backup/exact-runtime remedy. Older v2/v3/v4 requests can only replay an existing
identical receipt through HTTP/database; MCP and current clients remain strict v5.

Back up the complete database before upgrading, using SQLite backup and retaining history
and cursor keys. Returning to any pre-schema-7 binary requires that full pre-upgrade backup;
do not combine old inventory with newer receipts. See
[shared runtime adoption](architecture/shared-runtime-adoption.md) and
[event runtime accounting](architecture/event-runtime-accounting.md) for reproduction,
resource/worker bounds and the domain/core boundary.


Game post-state history retains at most 64 events / 2 MiB plus its complete checkpoint.
The envelope already contains a bounded resource replay tail. This smaller game journal
bounds synchronous history verification so account login and reconnect remain responsive
while both crews poll. Compaction preserves exact current replay and immutable command
receipts; an overtaken pagination cursor requires a fresh snapshot. The neutral fixture's
existing history defaults are unchanged.


Defensive platforms, ammunition and their lifecycle are documented in [game-units.md](game-units.md). SQLite schema 8 adds the compatibility guard; full combat remains unavailable.

Current combat extension: [combat-v1 authority, timing, visibility and interruption policy](game-combat.md). Combat-capable saves require schema 9 and the matching reviewed client.

Current final-result extension: [victory-v1 policy and verification](game-victory.md), requiring schema 10 and matching clients.
